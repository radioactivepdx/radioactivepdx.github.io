          Portland is contaminated with nuclear radiation, and it's getting worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are we going to do about it?
        <p>
          To answer that question, and to take action, we created <b>Radioactive Portland</b>.

              We just launched a few hours ago, so things are messy.
              This fledgling website just hosts the discussion group right now, but there's more
              to come. 
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll be adding sections to match <b>Radioactive Portland</b>'s three drivers:
              <ul>
                <li>Monitoring - Test results for background, rainwater, soil, food, milk</li>
                <li>Knowledge - Articles and videos on radiation, detection, ecology, health</li>
                <li>Action - Political, legal and commercial actions; calendar of events; trip reports</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our first order of business is to figure out when and where to meet up.
