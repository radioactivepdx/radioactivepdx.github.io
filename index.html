    Portland is contaminated with nuclear radiation, and it's getting worse.
  </p>
  <p>
    What are we going to do about it?
  <p>
    To answer that question, and to take action, we created <b>Radioactive Portland</b>.

        We just launched a few hours ago, so things are messy.
        This fledgling website just hosts the discussion group right now, but there's more
        to come. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll be adding sections to match <b>Radioactive Portland</b>'s three drivers:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Monitoring</b> - Test results for background, rainwater, soil, food, milk</li>
          <li><b>Knowledge</b> - Articles and videos on radiation, detection, ecology, health</li>
          <li><b>Action</b> - Political, legal and commercial actions; calendar of events; trip reports</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first order of business is to figure out when and where to meet up.
