title: Radioactive Portland Goes Live

We just launched a few hours ago, so things are messy.
This fledgling website just hosts the discussion group right now, but there's more
to come.

We'll be adding sections to match <b>Radioactive Portland</b>'s three drivers:

* **Monitoring** - Test results for background, rainwater, soil, food, milk
* **Knowledge** - Articles and videos on radiation, detection, ecology, health
* **Action** - Political, legal and commercial actions; calendar of events; trip reports

Our first order of business is to figure out when and where to meet up.
