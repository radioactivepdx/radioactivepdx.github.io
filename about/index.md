title: About Radioactive Portland

Portland is radioactive, especially when it rains.

Using a geiger counter, I've measured radioactive contamination in rainwater
10 times over normal background levels.  Nuclear radiation is accumulating
over time from decades of industrial and military activity.  It's in the water,
soil and food.  It's in the air we breathe.  Some of it comes from Hanford 200
miles up the Columbia River, and some of it has found its way here from Fukushima.

So we've formed this group, **Radioactive Portland**, to respond.  We'll conduct
monitoring, share knowledge and take direct action.  We'll meet weekly.
